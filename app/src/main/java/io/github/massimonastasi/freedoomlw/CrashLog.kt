/**
 * The last uncaught exception, written to a file so the next launch can offer to report it.
 *
 * There is no crash reporting SDK here and there will not be one. Every option on the market
 * brings Play Services, a background process that wakes on its own and network traffic the
 * user never asked for - which contradicts the one promise this application makes on its
 * settings screen, would need a privacy policy that is no longer one sentence, and makes it
 * unacceptable on F-Droid. This file is the whole of the alternative: about forty lines, no
 * permission, no network, and nothing leaves the device unless the user presses send in their
 * own browser, having read what it says.
 *
 * ## Where it writes
 *
 * `filesDir`, which is private to the application and removed when it is uninstalled. Not the
 * cache: the report has to survive until the user next opens the settings, and the system is
 * free to empty a cache directory whenever it likes - including during the crash loop that
 * would produce the report worth reading.
 *
 * ## One file, overwritten
 *
 * The newest crash replaces the older one. A directory of them would need pruning, a UI to
 * choose between them and a rule for what to do when they disagree; what someone reporting a
 * problem needs is the crash that just happened, and what a maintainer needs is one trace
 * rather than nine. If the same fault recurs the file simply says so again.

     *
     * Called from both entry points - the service and the settings screen - because there is
     * no Application subclass and adding one would be a class and a manifest entry to hold a
     * single line. They share a process, so whichever starts first wins and the flag makes the
